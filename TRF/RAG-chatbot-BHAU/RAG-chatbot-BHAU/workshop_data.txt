TRF stands for THE ROBOTICS FORUM.
The theme for ABU Robocon 2024, hosted by Vietnam, is inspired by the country’s traditional terraced rice fields. The competition will showcase robots simulating stages of rice cultivation, such as sowing seeds, harvesting rice, and transporting it to storage. This theme highlights the importance of efficient farming, symbolizing the prosperity that comes from these agricultural practices. The overall message is about promoting sustainability and technological innovation in farming​.
For this year's contest:
Robots: Each team will use two robots. One robot will handle tasks like planting rice seedlings in the sowing area, while the other will be involved in harvesting and transporting rice grains.
Arena: The competition area is divided into three zones: the Sowing Area, the Harvesting Area, and the Grain Storage Area, each representing different stages of the rice cultivation process. Teams need to maneuver their robots across these zones, complete tasks, and score points by successfully sowing seeds and harvesting rice.
Host Country: Vietnam, which is known for its rich rice cultivation culture and stunning terraced fields, is the host of Robocon 2024
For ABU Robocon 2024, where the theme is inspired by Vietnam's terraced rice fields, the two robots used by each team will perform distinct but complementary tasks related to rice cultivation. Here's a breakdown of the tasks expected of each robot:
Robot 1 (Seedling Robot):
Sowing Seeds: The first robot's primary task is to go to the Sowing Area and collect rice seedlings from the Seedling Shelf. It will then plant these seedlings in the Sowing Area, one at a time. Each successful planting earns the team 10 points.
Transporting Seedlings: The robot will have to navigate across different terrains within the arena to transport the seedlings from the Seedling Shelf to the planting area.
Robot 2 (Harvesting and Transport Robot):
Harvesting Rice: The second robot’s main role is to move to the Harvesting Area and collect rice grains or rice husks. It will then transport these grains to the Grain Storage Area.
Storing Rice: Once in the storage area, the robot must deposit the harvested rice into silos or tubes in the Grain Storage Area, with each successful transfer earning points.
Harvesting Efficiency: This robot needs to work in coordination with Robot 1 to ensure that the number of harvested rice grains does not exceed the number of seedlings planted, maintaining balance in the competition.
These tasks are designed to simulate a farming process, from planting rice to harvesting and storage, emphasizing precision and coordination between the two robots as they perform their roles in different stages of rice cultivation
That is what The R1 And R2 robots were made for.
The quadrapet bot was made to emulate the movement of a dog it walks by lifting one front leg and one hind in the opposite and placing it forward. It then continues this action.

The TRF Level One workshop, organized by the TRF team at VIT, Pune, is a highly immersive and comprehensive 20-day program designed to offer students their first in-depth exposure to the world of robotics. Attendees will be mentored by technical members of TRF. The workshop begins on November 15th and is open to students from all disciplines, providing a unique opportunity to gain both theoretical and hands-on experience in a variety of robotics domains. The workshop offers students the chance to explore the basics of electronics, programming, and mechanical design, providing an ideal starting point for those interested in the multidisciplinary field of robotics. The cost to enroll is 1000 rupees, and successful participants will receive a certificate of completion, which can be a valuable addition to their academic or professional credentials. The program also emphasizes teamwork and collaboration, as students will be grouped into teams of four, ensuring that they work together to solve problems and build robots.
Throughout the workshop, students will get a solid grounding in several key areas. The electronics portion covers fundamental concepts such as transistors, diodes, voltage regulators, motor drivers, digital circuits, and various components essential for building robotic systems. In the programming section, students will be introduced to the basics of C, C++, and Python, which are foundational languages for robotics and automation. These programming skills will allow students to understand how to control and program the robots they build. Additionally, students will gain exposure to mechanical design using software like CREO CAD, which is used to design the physical parts of a robot. This combination of theoretical learning and practical application prepares students for real-world robotics challenges.
The TRF Level One workshop provides students with a comprehensive robotics kit that includes various components necessary for building and programming robots. The kit contains the Rudra 7.0 Development board, a robotic arm with a gripper, a URJA dual-channel motor driver, an IR array of three sensors, two 12V DC motors, one MG995 servo motor, an OLED display, two wheels, a buzzer, two relays, an RGB LED, a potentiometer, four DPDT switches, one castor wheel, and a remote controller. With these components, students will be able to build robots capable of performing various functions, including pick and place, line tracing, color following, voice command recognition, and IoT applications. These robots can also be manually operated, giving students the freedom to control them in various ways. To program and control these robots, the workshop provides students with access to essential software tools, such as Python, Autodesk Fusion for mechanical design, MIT App Inventor for creating apps, and Arduino IDE for embedded systems programming.
The TRF Level One workshop also offers an opportunity for students to join TRF as a member by paying a one-time membership fee. The benefit of becoming a TRF member is that students will receive a 50 RS discount on all future workshop fees, which makes it an excellent option for those who wish to continue participating in TRF's workshops. This membership provides added value, especially for students who are looking to deepen their knowledge and skills in robotics and related fields. The registration process for both the workshop and the membership is straightforward and entirely online. Students can visit the TRF portal, log in with their credentials, and pay for the workshop through Paytm.

Students will also have the chance to interact with seniors and mentors who can guide them on their learning journey, helping them grow both technically and professionally.
The TRF Level One workshop also introduces students to the exciting world of competitive robotics. TRF is known for developing robots like BHAU, R1, R2, Quadrapet, self-balancing robots, and line-following robots, which are designed specifically for various competitions. BHAU, for example, is a humanoid robot that has evolved through seven generations. Its name stands for Brilliant, Helpful, Autonomous, and Unique, which reflects its advanced capabilities. BHAU uses a 3-wheel holonomic omni-drive system for movement and a Jetson Nano processor to process its surroundings. It can also perform intricate movements with its arms, using stepper motors and servo motors, and it can even gift a flower, showcasing its smart capabilities. BHAU can detect objects using computer vision and rotate its head using stepper motors, making it one of the most sophisticated robots developed by TRF.
Another key aspect of the workshop is that it prepares students to compete in events like ABU Robocon 2024. The theme for the upcoming ABU Robocon competition, hosted by Vietnam, draws inspiration from the country's traditional terraced rice fields. In this competition, robots will perform tasks related to rice cultivation, such as sowing seeds, harvesting rice, and transporting it to storage. Each team will use two robots: one robot will handle tasks like planting rice seedlings in the Sowing Area, while the other will be responsible for harvesting and transporting rice to the Grain Storage Area. This competition highlights the importance of efficiency and precision in farming, and it encourages innovation and sustainability in agricultural practices. The ABU Robocon 2024 competition is an excellent opportunity for students to apply what they have learned in the TRF Level One workshop and showcase their skills on a global stage.
